# Music-Recommendation-System
Using Linear Algebra and API integration to build a music recommendation system for Spotify

--Project objectives, overview, and set-up instructions will be posted here--

Important commands for the project:

"pip install -U numpy scipy scikit-learn" or "pip3 install -U numpy scipy scikit-learn"

Purpose: This command updates (or installs if not already installed) three Python libraries: NumPy, SciPy, and scikit-learn. Here’s what each of these libraries is used for:

1. NumPy

	•	Purpose: Provides support for numerical computations, especially working with large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices. It also has a wide array of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
	•	Why update? To access the latest features, improvements, and bug fixes.

2. SciPy

	•	Purpose: Built on top of NumPy, SciPy provides additional modules for scientific computing tasks like optimization, integration, interpolation, eigenvalue problems, and more.
	•	Why update? To ensure compatibility with the latest versions of other libraries (like NumPy) and improve performance or functionality.

3. scikit-learn

	•	Purpose: A machine learning library for Python. It provides tools for data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and deployment, including classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction.
	•	Why update? To use new machine learning algorithms or enhancements and keep up-to-date with recent developments.

Key Points:

	•	-U: Stands for “upgrade.” It ensures the latest versions of the libraries are installed.
	•	If the libraries are already installed, this command updates them to their newest available versions.
	•	If the libraries are not installed, it installs the latest versions.

"pip install python-dotenv"

Used to install the python-dotenv library into your Python environment. The python-dotenv library is helpful for managing environment variables (eg. API keys, database credentials etc.) in Python projects.

"pip install spotipy"

Used to install the spotipy library—a Python tool used for programmatically interacting with the Spotify Web API.
